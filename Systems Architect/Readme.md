# PROJECT E.L.L.A: Threaded System Guide for V3 - Systems Architect

## **E.L.L.A: Systems Architect - Threaded Data Router Guide for V3**

### **Role Objective:**

Design and implement a highly efficient, multi-threaded data recovery and routing system that prioritizes speed, scalability, and system robustness.

---

### **Phase 1: Understanding the Mission**

#### **Goal:**

Architect a high-speed, multi-threaded data routing system with the following objectives:

- **Prioritize speed and scalability** to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Prevent blocking I/O operations** during data retrieval to maintain responsiveness.
- **Implement robust fallback recovery mechanisms** in case of primary data retrieval failure.

---

### **Phase 2: Environment Setup**

#### **Requirements:**

- Python 3.10+
- Built-in `threading`, `queue`, and `time` libraries (no external dependencies required)

```bash
python3 -m venv ella_env
source ella_env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

### **Phase 3: Threaded Router (`router.py`)**

1. **Import Essentials:**

```python
import threading
import queue
import time
```

2. **Define Global Queues:**

```python
data_queue = queue.Queue()
result_queue = queue.Queue()
```

3. **Worker Thread Function:**

```python
def data_worker(source_id):
    while True:
        try:
            request = data_queue.get(timeout=2)
            print(f"[Source-{source_id}] Handling: {request}")
            # Simulate data fetch
            time.sleep(0.5)
            result = f"Result from Source-{source_id} for {request}"
            result_queue.put(result)
            data_queue.task_done()
        except queue.Empty:
            break
```

4. **Thread Initialization Function:**

```python
def run_router(num_sources=3):
    threads = []
    for i in range(num_sources):
        t = threading.Thread(target=data_worker, args=(i,))
        t.start()
        threads.append(t)
    
    # Populate queue with data requests
    for request_id in range(10):
        data_queue.put(f"DataRequest-{request_id}")

    data_queue.join()  # Wait until all data is processed
    
    # Join all threads
    for t in threads:
        t.join()

    # Display results
    while not result_queue.empty():
        print(result_queue.get())
```

---

### **Phase 4: Fallback System (`fallback_recovery.py`)**

1. **Design Fallback Logic:**

```python
def fallback_fetch(primary, backup):
    try:
        # Simulate primary failure
        raise ConnectionError("Primary failed")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Primary source failed: {e}. Switching to backup...")
        return f"Recovered from Backup for {primary}"
```

---

### **Phase 5: Integration and Testing**

To test the integration, use `main.py`:

```python
from router import run_router

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_router()
```

---

### **Phase 6: Optimization Ideas**

- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: For dynamic scaling based on load.
- **Logging**: Replace print statements with logging for better traceability.
- **Timeout and Retry Limits**: Implement to enhance fault tolerance.
- **Performance Profiling**: Use `time.perf_counter()` to measure and optimize execution time.
