# PROJECT E.L.L.A: Threaded System Guide for V3 - Data Handler

## **E.L.L.A: Data Handler - Threaded Data Router Guide for V3**

### **Role Objective:**

Manage and process data flow within the system, ensuring requests are handled efficiently and results are retrieved accurately and swiftly.

---

### **Phase 1: Understanding the Mission**

#### **Goal:**

Develop a data-handling mechanism that:

- **Ensures all requests are queued and processed efficiently**: Requests are placed in a queue and handled by multiple worker threads to maximize throughput.
- **Handles data requests and responses in parallel without blocking operations**: The system should be multi-threaded to process requests concurrently without waiting for each to finish before starting the next.
- **Implements fallback logic for data retrieval when primary sources fail**: In case of failure, the system should be able to switch to backup sources to ensure continuous data retrieval.

---

### **Phase 2: Environment Setup**

#### **Requirements:**

- Python 3.10+
- Built-in threading, queue, and time libraries (no external dependencies required)

To set up the environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv ella_env
source ella_env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

### **Phase 3: Threaded Router (router.py)**

#### **1. Import Essentials**

```python
import threading
import queue
import time
```

#### **2. Define Global Queues**

```python
# Queue for managing incoming data requests
data_queue = queue.Queue()

# Queue for storing processed results
result_queue = queue.Queue()
```

#### **3. Worker Thread Function**

This function will be executed by each thread. It processes requests by fetching data and placing results into the result queue.

```python
def data_worker(source_id):
    while True:
        try:
            request = data_queue.get(timeout=2)  # Wait for requests with a timeout
            print(f"[Source-{source_id}] Handling: {request}")
            # Simulate data fetch operation
            time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulating data retrieval delay
            result = f"Result from Source-{source_id} for {request}"
            result_queue.put(result)  # Place result in result queue
            data_queue.task_done()  # Mark the task as done
        except queue.Empty:
            break  # Exit when no more requests are left
```

#### **4. Thread Initialization Function**

This function initializes threads and manages the execution of the data workers.

```python
def run_router(num_sources=3):
    threads = []
    for i in range(num_sources):
        t = threading.Thread(target=data_worker, args=(i,))
        t.start()  # Start each worker thread
        threads.append(t)
    
    # Simulate 10 data requests
    for request_id in range(10):
        data_queue.put(f"DataRequest-{request_id}")  # Add requests to the queue

    data_queue.join()  # Wait for all data tasks to be completed

    for t in threads:
        t.join()  # Ensure all threads complete before proceeding

    # Output results after processing
    while not result_queue.empty():
        print(result_queue.get())  # Print the results from the result queue
```

---

### **Phase 4: Fallback System (fallback_recovery.py)**

#### **1. Design Fallback Logic**

In case the primary data retrieval method fails, fallback logic is triggered to attempt recovery from a backup source.

```python
def fallback_fetch(primary, backup):
    try:
        # Simulate primary source failure
        raise ConnectionError("Primary failed")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Primary source failed: {e}. Switching to backup...")
        return f"Recovered from Backup for {primary}"  # Return result from backup
```

---

### **Phase 5: Integration and Testing**

To test the integration, use the `main.py` script to invoke the `run_router` function.

```python
from router import run_router

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_router()  # Start the threaded data router
```

---

### **Phase 6: Optimization Ideas**

- **Implement dynamic scaling using ThreadPoolExecutor**: Replace `threading.Thread` with `ThreadPoolExecutor` for better dynamic thread management and load balancing.
- **Replace print statements with logging**: Use Pythonâ€™s `logging` library for better traceability and debug information.
- **Introduce retry mechanisms and timeouts**: Implement retry logic and timeouts to handle intermittent failures more gracefully.
- **Use time.perf_counter() to monitor and optimize performance**: Profile the time taken for each operation to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the system.

### **Conclusion**

By following the above structure, you can ensure that all data requests are handled efficiently in parallel, with proper fallback mechanisms in place for resilience. This system will scale effectively and handle high-volume data requests without blocking operations.
