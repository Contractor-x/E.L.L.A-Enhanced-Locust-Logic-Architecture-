# PROJECT E.L.L.A: Threaded System Guide for V3 - Caching Strategist

## **E.L.L.A: Caching Strategist - Threaded Data Router Guide for V3**

### **Role Objective:**

Design and implement a data caching system that enhances data retrieval speed, reduces latency, and prevents redundant data fetch operations within the multi-threaded framework.

---

### **Phase 1: Understanding the Mission**

#### **Goal:**

Create a caching layer that:

- **Stores frequently requested data**: The cache stores results of previously fetched data to minimize redundant network or database calls.
- **Minimizes the need to retrieve data from primary sources repeatedly**: Prevents unnecessary data fetching by serving data directly from the cache when it’s available.
- **Integrates seamlessly with the multi-threaded data routing and recovery system**: The caching system should work efficiently within the threaded architecture to avoid blocking and delays.

---

### **Phase 2: Environment Setup**

#### **Requirements:**

- Python 3.10+
- Built-in threading, queue, and time libraries (no external dependencies required)

To set up the environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv ella_env
source ella_env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

### **Phase 3: Threaded Router (router.py)**

#### **1. Import Essentials**

```python
import threading
import queue
import time
```

#### **2. Define Global Queues**

```python
# Queue for managing incoming data requests
data_queue = queue.Queue()

# Queue for storing processed results
result_queue = queue.Queue()
```

#### **3. Worker Thread Function with Caching**

We will use a dictionary to store cached data for quick retrieval.

```python
# Dictionary to store cached results
cache = {}

def data_worker(source_id):
    while True:
        try:
            request = data_queue.get(timeout=2)  # Wait for requests with a timeout
            if request in cache:
                result = cache[request]
                print(f"[Cache] Retrieved: {request} from cache")
            else:
                print(f"[Source-{source_id}] Handling: {request}")
                # Simulate data fetch operation
                time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulating data retrieval delay
                result = f"Result from Source-{source_id} for {request}"
                # Cache the result for future use
                cache[request] = result
            result_queue.put(result)  # Place result in result queue
            data_queue.task_done()  # Mark the task as done
        except queue.Empty:
            break  # Exit when no more requests are left
```

#### **4. Thread Initialization Function**

This function initializes threads and manages the execution of the data workers.

```python
def run_router(num_sources=3):
    threads = []
    for i in range(num_sources):
        t = threading.Thread(target=data_worker, args=(i,))
        t.start()  # Start each worker thread
        threads.append(t)
    
    # Simulate 10 data requests
    for request_id in range(10):
        data_queue.put(f"DataRequest-{request_id}")  # Add requests to the queue

    data_queue.join()  # Wait for all data tasks to be completed

    for t in threads:
        t.join()  # Ensure all threads complete before proceeding

    # Output results after processing
    while not result_queue.empty():
        print(result_queue.get())  # Print the results from the result queue
```

---

### **Phase 4: Fallback System (fallback_recovery.py)**

#### **1. Design Fallback Logic**

If the primary data source fails, the system will fall back to a backup source to ensure data availability.

```python
def fallback_fetch(primary, backup):
    try:
        # Simulate primary source failure
        raise ConnectionError("Primary failed")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Primary source failed: {e}. Switching to backup...")
        return f"Recovered from Backup for {primary}"  # Return result from backup
```

---

### **Phase 5: Integration and Testing**

To test the integration, use the `main.py` script to invoke the `run_router` function.

```python
from router import run_router

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_router()  # Start the threaded data router
```

---

### **Phase 6: Optimization Ideas**

- **Implement caching expiry to avoid stale data**: Introduce a cache expiration mechanism to ensure that cached data is not served when it becomes outdated.
- **Use logging for better tracking**: Replace `print` statements with Python’s `logging` library to enable better traceability and debug information.
- **Optimize cache memory usage**: Consider using a more advanced caching mechanism (e.g., `LRU Cache`) to limit the size of the cache and remove old entries.
- **Profile performance using time.perf_counter()**: Profile the time taken for each operation, focusing on cache hits and misses, to further optimize the caching mechanism.
